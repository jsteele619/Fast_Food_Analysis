Analyzing fast food chains against population demographics and health data in California

Project authors: Dominica Corless, Kelsey Cox, Jeremy Jang, Jeremy Steele, Stanley Tan

## The Data

We used several sources for the data, all governmental sources. Data on the number of fast food restaurants in each county in California came from [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/go-to-the-atlas/). California Census Data came from the Census API using the [Census Package](https://github.com/datamade/census). Health data came from the [CDC](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/diabetes/DiabetesAtlas.html).

Revised and collected data we then used to draw conclusions can be found in:
* [California County Population 2011 and 2016](Analysis/data/county_2011_2016.csv)
* [California Census Data 2011](Analysis/data/census_data_2011.csv)
* [California Census Data 2016](Analysis/data/census_data_2016.csv)
* [Fast Food and Health Data by County 2011 and 2016](Analysis/data/big_df.csv)
